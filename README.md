# NFT Bot

A Discord bot for NFT collectors and traders. This bot collected real-time and historical data from multiple APIs to give a user insights into NFT collections, gas prices, wallet stats, licensing metadata, market trend, and some more, and it fed it all into a discord server.

i also removed the TLS client i created, so this probably wont work without importing a new one
